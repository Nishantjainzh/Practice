1.	we will give 3rd perameter as next and will call next() within function in middleware.
2.	Model is like a database schema where we will put the info pertaining to the collections,  model name should be like collection name.
3.	Node js default port â€“ 8000
4.	mongodb default port  27017

                                                                JAVA SCRIPT
1.	JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language which means only one thing can happen at a time.
2.	Using asynchronous JavaScript (such as callbacks, promises, and async/await), you can perform long network requests without blocking the main thread.
3.	RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for reactive programming using observables that makes it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code .The library also provides utility functions for creating and working with observables.
4.	RxJS is a library that lets us create and work with observables.

5.	Injectable means Dependency injection

6.	observables are simply a function that are able to give multiple values over time, either synchronously or asynchronously
7.	An Observable is like a Stream (in many languages) and allows to pass zero or more events where the callback is called for each event.
8.	With Observable it doesn't matter if you want to handle 0, 1, or multiple events.

9.	the main difference between a promise and an observable is that a promise emits only a single value, whereas an observable emits multiple values.

10.	Interceptors allow us to intercept incoming or outgoing HTTP requests using the HttpClient.
11.	we will generate the inceptor and it should be register in module.ts under the provider with [provide:HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,useClass:BoyInterceptor,multi:true  ]
12.	hoisting- variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution - in this case function will be print but variable would become undefind.

13.	var- we can declare again it and we can rewrite the value again 
let -we can rewrite the value but we can not declare it again.
const-neither we can declare nor rewrite value.
14.	Closure - to use the outside function variable in the inner function and closures can be perform with local variable and global variable.

15.	pipes - uppercase, lowercase ,titlecase.

16.	Route Guard- need to generate Guard and service

17.	@view child-USING COMPONENT -  its a decorator and it is used for component communication. if a parent component wants to use child component then we can use it. 
18.	@view child-USING TEMPLATE VARIBALE-  its a decorator. WE will use ElementRef in it. 

19.	Directives- It is use for modify the DOM and HTML Element.We will use ElementRef in it.
Directives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications.
With Angular's built-in directives, you can manage forms, lists, styles, and what users see.
20.	Data types - <String, Number, Boolean, Array, Object, Null>
21.	OPERATOR <AND  -  && OR  -  ||>
22.	BOX < alert();  prompt(); confirm();>
23.	<console.log("")
24.	console.warn();
document.write();
console.table([1,2,3])
console.error()>
25.	<Below console would be use together.>
console.time("test")
console.Endtime("test")

26.	ARRAY METHOD <Array methods will be use with . >
27.		var a = [ 1,2,3];
28.		a.sort()
29.	sort() - it will sort the array in alphabetical order or in number series order
30.	reverse() - it will reverse the values of array 
31.	pop() - it will delete the last value of the array
32.	push(value) - it will add the value in the last in the array.
33.	shift()- it will delete the first value of the array
34.	unshift() - it will add the value in the beginning in the array.
35.	concat() - it will add the arrays value
36.	join()

37.	New feature of ANGULAR 11
Updated HMR
type script 5 suppot
webpack 5 support
moved from Tslint to ESLint
remove support from IE 9, 10
38.	WEBPACK- its a bundler which put all the JS file in a single JS file. Webpack has its own server , the name is webpack-dev-server
39.	GULP- Dist and src folder would be created

40.	INTERCEPTOR- It is like a middleware
Interceptors are a unique type of Angular Service that we can implement.
Interceptors allow us to intercept incoming or outgoing HTTP requests using the HttpClient . 
By intercepting the HTTP request, we can modify or change the value of the request.

41.	Functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous
A good example is JavaScript setTimeout()

42.	ngOnInit() is a place to put the code that we need to execute at very first as soon as the class is instantiated.
Constructor initialize class members.

43.	ActivatedRoute Contains the information about a route associated with a component loaded in an outlet. 
It can also be used to pass data from one component to another component using route such as Id, flag, state etc.

44.	SnapShot - If you don't want to update your URL parameter within the same component you are accessing it, then you can use the snapshot

45.	ParamMap - A map that provides access to the required and optional parameters specific to a route. 
46.	The map supports retrieving a single value with get() or multiple values with getAll().

47.	npm init command for create the package.json

48.	ExpressJS manages the workflow between the front-end and the database and facilitates a smooth and secure transfer of data

49.	Angular gives us 8 hooks to allow us to tap into the lifecycle of our components and trigger actions at specific points in the lifecycle.

ngOnChanges ngOnInit  ngDoCheck   ngAfterContentInit  ngAfterContentChecked ngAfterViewInit ngAfterViewChecked  ngOnDestroy.
50.	Decorators are functions that allow a service, directive or filter to be modified prior to its usage
It adds additional metadata information like the template, selector name, styles etc.
51.	CORS allows servers to specify who (i.e., which origins) can access the assets on the server, among many other things.

52.	Concurrency - Concurrency is the concept of executing two or more tasks at the same time. We can handle it with events and callback in node js.

53.	ng-template is an Angular element used to render HTML templates. We use ng-template with angular *ngIf directive to display else template.

54.	Two way binding get implemented with [(ngModel)]
When we need to display and update the same data then we used to two way binding

55.	Mongoose, you can define objects with a strongly-typed schema that can be further mapped to a MongoDB document.
Mongoose comes with built-in typecasting, validation, query building, business logic hooks, and many more out-of-the-box features.
We use the mongoose db library for connnect the mongo db database.
Mongoose is a mongoDB Object Data Modeling(ODM) library for MongoDb and nodeJs.

56.	The main objective of a service is to organize and share business logic, models, or data and functions with different components of an Angular application.

57.	Variables created without a declaration keyword (var, let, or const) are always global, 
even if they are created inside a function.

58.	Recursion is a process of calling itself. A function that calls itself is called a recursive function.
It is calling itself inside the function. Working of recursion in JavaScript. A recursive function must have a condition to stop calling itself.

59.	then() method is used to access the result when the promise is fulfilled.

60.	catch() method is used to access the result/error when the promise is rejected.

61.	reduce() method takes a callback function with two parameters (accumulator, currentValue) as arguments

62.	pipe() to make a chain of operators ( filter(map( scan()))
	.map() method execute and apply on each element of the array.
	Tap() does not modify the source observable in any way

63.	forEach() method executes a callback function on each of the elements in an array in order.

64.	filter() this methods return the true and false as per the condition.

67.	Rest parameter is used in function declaration whereas the spread operator is used in function calls.

68.	Index: true in mongodb schema - it fast the query to search the values

69.	lodash library - 
_.concat() - it add the values in existing array.
_.find() - it find the specific object
_.intersection() -it find the common elements between two arrays.
_.isObject() - method is used to find whether the given value is an object or not. It gives true and false.
_.keys()- method is used to return the list of all keys of the given object.

70.	==> Build Creation
 We need to install the typescript (npm install -g typescript)
 then need to generate tsconfig.json file by (tsc --init) and put the "outDir": "dist"} under compilerOptions 
 then and put the {"build": "tsc"} under scripts in package.json file
 and run the build command - npm run build

71.	FS Module
	writeFileSync() - for creating a file
	unlinkSync() - for deleting a file 
	readdir() - for reading the file name under a directory

==========================
NODE JS MODULE COMPLETE
==========================
Pupeteer - It is used for create the pdf
handlebars - It is used for render web pages to the client side from data on the server-side
FS module- For file read, create, update, delete.
path - this is inbuilt function of express for making the folder and file path
